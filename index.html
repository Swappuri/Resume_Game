          Hi, I'm Swapnil Puri! I'm a computer science student at St. Edward's University, set to graduate in Spring 2026. 
          At St. Edward's, I serve as the meeting coordinator for the university's computer science club and was honored 
          with the Outstanding First-Year Computer Science Student Award. I have also consistently maintained a 4.0 GPA.

          I had the opportunity to intern at Dell Technologies as a software engineering intern, where I developed a 
          graphical user interface in Java to communicate with an Arduino Uno, emulating a mouse. Additionally, I 
          helped programmed the microcontroller using C++. My team followed agile practices, conducting daily standups 
          and managing project deadlines through Microsoft Teams. Ultimately, we were recognized for designing the most 
          innovative computer peripheral in a competition against two other intern groups.

          I have experience with a diverse range of programming languages and software. I am a C++ Certified Associate 
          Programmer, having demonstrated proficiency through an exam administered by the C++ Institute. I also completed 
          the Meta Front-End Developer Course on Coursera, where I gained expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and 
          UX/UI design. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with Java, Python, R, SQL, and PHP. I am proficient in 
          using tools such as Git, GitHub, MySQL, Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, Processing, Figma, and Tableau.
