This is the official gamified resume of Swapnil Puri, built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the GSAP library. It features an animated slime character (sourced from Kenney) that players can control: use the "A" and "D" keys to move and the "W" key to jump. The maps, created with Kenney's block assets, include two key elements: a sign and a door. Interacting with the sign displays information about Swapnil Puri in a text box, while reaching the door transitions to the next level, introducing new map elements. Progress continues through signs and doors until the final level is reached.
